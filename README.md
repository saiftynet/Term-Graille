# Term-Graille
Braille Characters for Terminal Graphical Applications

Drawille is a method of using Braille characters as a mechanism for graphical display in a terminal.  Ports of the original by [asciimoo](https://github.com/asciimoo/drawille) exist inmultiple other languages including [Perl](https://metacpan.org/dist/Term-Drawille), [Java](https://github.com/null93/drawille), [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/drawille), [NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/drawille), and others.  The {Perl version](https://github.com/hoelzro/term-drawille) was initially produced by [@hoelzro](https://hoelz.ro/), but not much changed since about 8 years ago.

This is another Perl version, targeting ANSII compatible consoles. It delivers significantly higher performance and extends Term::Drawille by including features like:- 

* Integrated Turtle-like drawing
* Built-in drawing primitives including line and curve, circle, ellipse, polyline more on the way
* Scrolling with or without wrapping
* Some frame border manipulation
* Text overlays

Tools in other languages have been used in publications, system monitoring tools and for games. Term::Graille allows Perl programmers access to a expanding set of features for developing simple general purpose graphics, graphing applications, games etc from the console.

Features to be included are colors, sprites, maps, and more on user request.
